Description: This template is designed to speed up the process of compiling a decent 
  and well organized (at least according to me) README.Rmd  . It does that by formatting
  the global chunk options with the most common features and It also sets up a clear 
  path/workflow to be assertive in explaning the project's aim. Moreover It gently pushes
  the project leader to split up main files into different files (.R , .bib) according 
  to their respective unique goals.
